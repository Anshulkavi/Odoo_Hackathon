# Skill Swap Platform

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In today's skill-driven world, many individuals possess valuable talents they are willing to share, but lack a structured way to exchange those skills with others. The **Skill Swap Platform** addresses this gap by providing a mini-application where users can offer their expertise in certain areas and request skills they wish to learn in return — all without involving money. This fosters community learning, collaboration, and mutual growth.

The platform enables users to:
- Create public or private profiles
- List skills they can teach and those they want to learn
- Browse and search other users by skills
- Send, accept, reject, or delete swap requests
- Leave feedback after a completed swap

Administrators can:
- Moderate content and users
- Ban policy violators
- View platform-wide activity and reports
- Broadcast messages to users

This platform promotes a barter-style learning culture powered by digital tools.
